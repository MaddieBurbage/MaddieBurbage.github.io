# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I'm excited to explore what computers are capable of, whether by solving complex problems through algorithms inspired by ants, researching how to evolve hardware to fit our needs, or reading about new methods of integrating computers into cellular biology. I've thoroughly enjoyed learning and researching topics related to **Computer Architecture** and **Reconfigurable Hardware Design**, although I have experience in **Web Development** from independent projects.

I'm a junior at Williams College so luckily I'll get to go back to the Berkshires this fall. I've always loved being outside, when I'm not online anyway, and my favorite activities have been **bouldering** (climbing for those who fear heights), **skiing** (which I can now say with authority is better on the West Coast), and **hiking** (perfect for the college student in a rural town with no transport).

# **My Start**
My journey with computers began in the mid-2000s, when two of my aunts showed a much younger me some of the wonders of technology. In the decades before Zoom became a household name, my Aunt Denise has been revolutionizing virtual learning techniques for teaching the blind. I've been quite lucky to learn skills from her that would make anyone's time online more easy and fun. Years before I could type without finger pecking, she helped me explore the brave new world of the laptop through keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse clicks. I didn't fully realize how unique my early computer education was until much later, when I saw her teaching the same skills to technically-proficient adults. She taught me to use technology creatively, always questioning and experimenting with what we could adapt our machines for next. I also learned how incredibly powerful technology can be: how intractable problems are reduced to nothing after we produce seemingly-unrelated innovation.

My Aunt Cheryl gave me the final push into the world of development in 4th grade, when she introduced me to the exciting world of blogging. Back then I was passionately following any websites that posted cute animal photos and I couldn't wait to start sharing animal information myself. Maybe a little foolishly, I quickly got a blog together, 4leggedfriends. With the help of another young 2-legged friend I soon began to fill it up with enthusiastic, but quite amateur, animal facts and polls.

My first blog, and soon next, gave me the confidence and passion to pursue more complex web development, beyond the confines of a blogging platform. I loved customizing the site, adding content, and giving it exciting new features like carousels or image galleries. Now when I built a whole website, [Learn Latin](/projects/learnlatin), I could add whatever I could think up. As I slowly entered the world of programming, I found the same to be true whether I was building a website, app, or CLI. Although the classes I've taken have given me the skills to make these programs a reality, I'm driven to create by the same sense of wonder and curiosity that I had when I was a kid learning from my aunts.
