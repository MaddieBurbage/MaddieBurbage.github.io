			<h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="pictures/spaceneedle.png" alt="Seattle Space Needle">
			<p>I've lived in Seattle my whole life, and in 2018 I graduated from Lakeside
      School. Some of my favorite things coming out of high school have centered
      around the mountains around Seattle: on free days I love exploring through
      hiking, climbing, and skiing. I've also always loved puzzles and games, and
      this thrill in puzzle-solving hooked me into programming.</p>

      <p> I started coding in middle school and grew to love it through bigger
      projects my junior and senior years. Now I'm off at Williams College in
      Massachusetts studying Computer Science. My favorite class so far explored
      some of the many languages and circuits that compose computer architecture.
      I've enjoyed creating websites and making java apps, but before
      this year I had never worked with memory or logic at such a low level.
      Working closer to the base of the machine has a satisfying logic to it.</p>
