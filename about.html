			<h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="pictures/spaceneedle.png" alt="Seattle Space Needle">
			<p>I'm a Seattle native and it shows: most of my favorite things
			coming out of high school center on Seattle culture and the mountains
			surrounding the city. On free days I love exploring my surroundings
			through hiking, climbing, and skiing. When it rains, as it often
			does, I'm happy to spend time on puzzles and board games, and this
			has translated well to my passion for computer programming.</p>
      <img src="pictures/cow.png" alt="Williams Cow in Blue-green" style="float:left">
      		<p> I started coding in middle school and grew to love it through bigger
      		projects my junior and senior years. Now I'm off at Williams College in
	      	Massachusetts studying Computer Science. My favorite class so far explored
	      	some of the many languages and circuits that compose computer architecture.
	      	I'm excited to now be conducting undergraduate research on some of those
			same topics.</p>
