# The Learn Latin Website
Thanks to some amazingly engaging teachers, I somehow ended up taking Latin for 7 years rather than a more practical language, like Spanish or Chinese. Clearly there's a reason why the internet is awash with creative, interesting, or gimmicky language-learning sites for the latter two languages. Yet even if Latin serves a much smaller community, its students would be well-served by at least one good website.

## The Start
Before creating Learn Latin, I'd relied on my textbooks and teachers for any learning, practice, or review. My friends and I had looked online for other resources but there weren't many comprehensive ones. Gradually we discovered two great sites: [Warmenhoven's Latin Resources](https://www.warmenhoven.org/latin/vocab/) and the [Perseus Library](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/). The Perseus library has a very sophisticated dictionary interface, connected to a convenient open library of Latin works. However it's focused on reading Latin texts, not on teaching skills or words. Warmenhoven's resources were great for studying alongside the popular Wheelock's textbook, and were exactly the sort of tools I wanted to extend. But his site focused on simple word-practicing drills, and didn't include any reference content. Considering that the 2014 internet couldn't hit me with a single site improving on these, I set out to fix the gaps in Latin resources myself. My priorities in creating a Latin website were to add good grammar lessons and a sophisticated word-practice tool.

## The Site
I'd had practice with a relative of Wordpress, Wordpress.com, through my adventures in blogging as a kid (see some teens' guides on [crafting](https://sillypudding.wordpress.com) or the elementary schooler's predictably amateur attempt at a [universal animal encyclopedia](https://4leggedfriends.wordpress.com)). Since I didn't know any web development in 2015, I decided to take baby steps with a Wordpress site.

The colors were important: I wanted to give Latin all the classical prestige it deserved. This, of course, meant the primary color would be [Tyrian Purple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_purple): an expensive dye prized by the Romans.
