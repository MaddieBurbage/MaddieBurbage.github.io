        <h2>Purpose</h2>
				<img  src="/pictures/Adjectives.png" alt="The Adjectives Tester">
        <p>The trickiest part of picking up the Latin language is its very different
		style of grammar. Unlike English, the order of words in a sentence really
		doesn't matter, and writers need to add endings to words to tell readers
		what words mean. The system gives a lot of flexibility to poets but requires
		a lot of memorization for learners. For instance, every noun has 12 forms,
		adjectives can have 36 forms, and verbs have upwards of 250 forms.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Most other languages have ample tools available to learn their vocabulary
		and forms, but Latin is, well, dead. So Latina is pretty unique as a tool
		to teach word forms. Users can hone in on problem areas by selecting which
		types of words to drill and through clever grading they can try to fix
		their mistakes before seeing the corrected answers. Flexible dictionaries
		mean that users can import whichever words they are learning at the moment
		to get practice that fits their education. Right now Latina is completed
		for nouns and adjectives but I could see extending it for verbs and further
		parts of speech later.</p>

      <div class = "panel right">
        <h2>Grammar</h2>
				<img  src="/pictures/Corrections.png" alt="Word Corrections">
        <p>The largest component of the project was to program a customizable but
		accurate grammar-checker. Beyond finding all the patterns in word forms,
		I searched for similarities in patterns across words so the space
		requirements of the program wouldn't explode as I added more features.
