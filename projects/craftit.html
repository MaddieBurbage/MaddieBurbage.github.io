      <p style="display:inline;">(November/December 2017)</p>
      <p>A dynamic community-based crafting website. <a href="https://github.com/MaddieBurbage/CraftIt">The Repository.</a></p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
		<img  src="/pictures/Searching.png" alt="CraftIt Search Results">
        <p>I have fond memories of learning to knit scarves with my aunt and
		sawing blocks of wood into a toy train with my dad. They're both excellent
		craftspeople and it shows in their creations and their ease with teaching.
		What I did miss growing up was an easy way to learn how to make things that
		my family wasn't able to teach. If a crafting idea didn't start with
		a food I could find on AllRecipes I would have to scroll through endless blog
		results on Google to find a starting point for my project. I designed
		CraftIt to be a solution to my problem, a site where users could easily
		create and share every type of craft with the world. Most importantly,
		searchers hoping to find the perfect inspiration could easily narrow down
		crafts until they found something that worked for them.

		<h2>User Interface</h2>
        <p>To make crafting tutorials relevant to wannabe-creators, I had some
		important info to gather. For starters, logistics like time taken, materials
		used, and style of craft would be very important to anyone searching for
		the perfect project. My design for the project creation page was a careful
		balance between info necessary for searchers to have a successful time on
		the site and creators adding projects with ease.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "panel right">
		<h2>Data Storage</h2>
		<img  src="/pictures/StarHeader.png" alt="Project Header">
        <p>Beyond initial project creation, I wanted to make user feedback and
		interaction easy so that each user would have a successful time with the
	 	site. Features like rating projects, reviewing and sharing photos with
		other users, and saving favorite projects were all useful tools to
		shape the search and recommendation processes on CraftIt. Of course, this
		on top of project and user data adds up to a lot of data storage and
		retrieval. Through a combination of PHP and JavaScript with Ajax, I
		made the site respond fluidly to user input, whether in the login, search,
		or review process. This was also my first rigorous introduction to SQL,
		which powered databases containing the bulk of the site, as the true
		depth of the site lies in user-inputted data rather than any pages I
		might make.</p>
