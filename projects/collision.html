        <h2>Components</h2>
				<img src="/pictures/Gameplay.jpg" alt="The Collision Game">
        <p>This was the first full-fledged game I'd made on Unity so there was quite
        a learning curve. Besides all the features of the program, there were new
        systems and files to use for game design. Considering file storage on multiple platforms,
        animation mechanics, and progressive level generation were the biggest tasks.</p>

        <h2>Mechanics</h2>
        <p>Challenging the user to the right extent is a tricky balance. I wanted to
        have the game be accessible to everyone but interesting as time grew, so I
        based the game progression on an endless series of leveling. Linking rewards
        to obstacles in the generation of every level provided a continual hook for gameplay.
        Upgrades, the only permanent feature besides leveling up, are designed to be more
        integral to gameplay, as the player's main counterweight to the harshness of space.
        Most powerups in the game are unexplained, as I want the user to push themself
        into testing new abilities. Since they are temporary and uncommon, they add
        novelty to the game as well.</p>

      <div class = "panel right">
        <h2>Graphics</h2>
				<img src="/pictures/Graphics.jpg" alt="The Collision Game">
        <p>By far the most intimidating and pace-slowing part of the project was
        creating graphics and animations. I've never made graphics before but wanted
        the look of the game to match gameplay. Luckily the object-oriented nature
        of Unity allowed for similar sprites to use similar animation types, and even
        if I was drawing a completely new sprite I could follow the same styles as
        the previous sprites had.</p>
