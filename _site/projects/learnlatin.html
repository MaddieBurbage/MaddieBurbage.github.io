  <h1 id="the-learn-latin-website">The Learn Latin Website</h1>
<p>Thanks to some amazingly engaging teachers, I somehow ended up taking Latin for 7 years rather than a more practical language, like Spanish or Chinese. Clearly there’s a reason why the internet is awash with creative, interesting, or gimmicky language-learning sites for the latter two languages. Yet even if Latin serves a much smaller community, its students would be well-served by at least one good website.</p>

<h2 id="the-start">The Start</h2>
<p>Before creating Learn Latin, I’d relied on my textbooks and teachers for any learning, practice, or review. My friends and I had looked online for other resources but there weren’t many comprehensive ones. Gradually we discovered two great sites: <a href="https://www.warmenhoven.org/latin/vocab/">Warmenhoven’s Latin Resources</a> and the <a href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/">Perseus Library</a>. The Perseus library has a very sophisticated dictionary interface, connected to a convenient open library of Latin works. However it’s focused on reading Latin texts, not on teaching skills or words. Warmenhoven’s resources were great for studying alongside the popular Wheelock’s textbook, and were exactly the sort of tools I wanted to extend. But his site focused on simple word-practicing drills, and didn’t include any reference content. Considering that the 2014 internet couldn’t hit me with a single site improving on these, I set out to fix the gaps in Latin resources myself. My priorities in creating a Latin website were to add good grammar lessons and a sophisticated practice tool.</p>

<h2 id="the-site">The Site</h2>
<p>I’d had practice with a relative of Wordpress, Wordpress.com, through my adventures in blogging as a kid (see some teens’ guides on <a href="https://sillypudding.wordpress.com">crafting</a> or the elementary schooler’s predictably amateur attempt at a <a href="https://4leggedfriends.wordpress.com">universal animal encyclopedia</a>). Since I didn’t know any web development in 2015, I decided to take baby steps with a Wordpress site.

The colors were important: I wanted to give Latin all the classical prestige it deserved. This, of course, meant the primary color would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrian_purple">Tyrian Purple</a>: an expensive dye prized by the Romans. But beyond the colors and looks, which were my first instinct considering the last practice site I’d seen had 0 CSS files, I really wanted to make sure the site was quick and easy to use. I filled it with encyclopedia-style articles on all the Latin grammar topics that a high school Latin student could expect to see, with plenty of examples in English and Latin. Here’s a page on the uses of the Genitive case, which you think is easy when you first learn it, until you hear all the many many ways Romans liked to use it.

It was quite a test of my memory, and grammar base, to review so many uses of a single case! But even while I created the site I found myself referring back to old articles to help me. When my Latin studies focused more on reading exciting epics or hilarious poems, and grammar specifics were less center-of-mind, having a fast source of information was invaluable.</p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>One year after I started this site, I took my first high school coding class! Although I’d taught myself JavaScript to create some simple word drills on the site, I wanted to make them much more sophisticated. For a final project I got to achieve this, creating the Java program LatinaLingua (check it out on the projects page). And it was so satisfying to finally have the intelligent practice app that my friends in other language classes had always had access to.</p>

<p>It may not have been the wisest plan to attempt running a site with no ads on my limited high school summer-based income. Looking back, I’m not sure I would have changed that, but now that I’m making more than minimum wage I’d love to take the project on again. There are certainly some big updates I’d make; having done a lot of research in college I’ve been exposed to many more encyclopedias and wikis than in 2015. They each have some great design features that make reference and exploration easy and intuitive, and I’d love to redo the site with that in mind. I’ve also done a few more web projects by now! No longer limited to just Wordpress and JavaScript, I could integrate LatinaLingua into the website itself, and extend the learning side of the site to be as comprehensive as the reference side.</p>
