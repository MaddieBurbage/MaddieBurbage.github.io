			<h2>What's New?</h2>
			<p>This semester I've been taking a class on parallel processing,
				learning how to speed my programs up safely by using various
				parallel coding techniques. I've decided to finish the year out
				by applying these techniques to the intriguing suite of ant-colony
				optimization techniques. Based on the work of Marco Dorigo in 1992,
				ant-colony optimization seeks to solve complex graph-based problems
				by making programs act like ants. In nature, ants in a colony cooperate
				to find food by leaving trails of pheromones (chemical attractants)
				that other ants can follow. The more ants traveling a certain route,
				the stronger the pheromones are for that route. By simulating ant
				movement and pheromone changes, a program can efficiently find
				good solutions to graph-based problems, which is especially useful
				when those problems are NP-hard. To simulate these ants I'll be
				creating parallel processes in C with the Message Passing Interface
				(MPI). My aim is to find good solutions to the classic traveling
				salesman problem in reasonable amounts of time. I'll do this by
				investigating different parallel organization and optimizations
				of these virtual ants and their pheromones.</p>
