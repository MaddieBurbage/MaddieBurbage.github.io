- title: Research Assistant, Williams College Computer Science Department
  from: 2020
  to: present
  description: >-
    Working with Professor Duane Bailey on hardware design for reconfigurable
    devices. After I built the Linux boxes I'd be using for the summer, I
    focused on desigining configurable circuitry in Chisel and Scala for FPGAs.
    Besides designing circuitry I implemented several hardware accelerators
    for the open source Rocket Chip, a RISC-V processor created by UC Berkeley.
    I modified the processor's CPU to measure speedup and energy use effectively,
    and benchmarked the designs with C code and bash scripts.

  to: 2022
  description: >-
    Studying Computer Science, Math, and History in the beautiful Berkshires.
    Organizations like Williams Students Online have let me improve student
    services through my web development experience, while clubs like UnICS have
    been a great way to meet similarly motivated CS students.
- title: Camp Instructor, Coding With Kids
  from: June 2018
  to: August 2018
  description: >-
    Taught coding lessons to beginner and intermediate students,
    ages 5-12. Developed computer, math, and critical thinking skills through
    animation and game design projects. Provided lessons and individualized
    instruction in Java, Scratch, robotics, and application design. Additionally,
    managed camp centers and electronic equipment.
- title: Student, Lakeside School
  from: 2014
  to: 2018

    Lakeside gave me a fantastic foundation in many fields, including
    mathematics and computer science. Our CS classes went beyond the fundamentals
    of object-oriented programming, letting us explore web development and arduino
    design. Through long-term projects I got to hone design and presentation
    skills while developing fun applications.
