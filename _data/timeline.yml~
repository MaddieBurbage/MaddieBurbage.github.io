  description: Working with Professor Duane Bailey on hardware design for reconfigurable devices. After I assembled and configured the computers I'd be using for the summer, I focused on desigining circuitry and accelerators for FPGA boards. I used Chisel and Scala to generate Verilog circuit descriptions, which I then transferred to a Nexys A7 FPGA with Vivado. Besides designing configurable circuits I implemented several hardware accelerators for the open source Rocket Chip, a RISC-V processor created by UC Berkeley. To test these designs I created benchmarks with C and bash scripts.

  description: Studying Computer Science, Math, and History in the beautiful Berkshires. Organizations like Williams Students Online have let me improve student services through my web development experience, while clubs like UNICS have been a great way to meet similarly motivated CS students. I've also loved my access to the outdoors here, and groups like the Williams Outing Club and the Sailing and Climbing teams have helped me explore novel activities in nature.
